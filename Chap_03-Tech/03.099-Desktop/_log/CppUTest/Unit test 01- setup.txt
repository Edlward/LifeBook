Once installed it should be possible to create C/C++ Unit run targets where you can select CppUTest as test-runner.



To set up a launch target for the monitoredImpulseTest as example, 
1.open Run Configurations... under the run button on the menu row. 

2.Select a new configuration of "C/C++ Unit" type. In the name row, type e.g. monitoredImpulseTest, 

3.in C/C++ Application browse to the exe file created when building the test, i.e. components/application/aaesGeneric/monitoredImpulse/unitTest/_output/win_test_runner.exe.

4.In Project, browse to the SwingDoorPlatform project. If you like to enable autobuild you will have to create a new Build Configuration, that builds this particular test, and then add that. Otherwise, check Disable auto build, and build manually with the target in the build pane. 

5.Then go to the C/C++ Testing tab, and in the drop-down list you should be able to select "CppUTest Test Runner"

6.And finally, if you like to run the test outside the ide you can just start a command prompt, go to the folder were the test binary is created and run it with command "win_test_runner -c". The -c is just to color the "Pass" message green and the "Fail" message red.
